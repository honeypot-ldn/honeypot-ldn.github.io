	A member is someone who:

- is **enthusiastic about infosec**: they find this interesting, fun and are keen to learn, beginners welcome! [Infosec](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Information_security) comprises of so many areas, from more on the technical side (eg. [penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test), cryptography, [intelligence gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence), forensics, etc.) to more on the "political" side (eg. privacy and surveillance), that there really is a lot to choose from, for every technical level
- is **committed**: for example by attending meetups fairly regularly (via video chat is also an option as not everyone lives close to central london), and by contributing (knowledge, organising)
- is **proactive**: both in the sense that they take the initiative to organise meetups, and they are independent on the computer (ie. googles things for themselves, they are curious and poke around things to understand them)
- **doesn't blame the user**: important in the context of this group especially ! A good read: [A story about Jessica](http://swiftonsecurity.tumblr.com/post/98675308034/a-story-about-jessica) - The idea is to not react like "The user deserved to be hacked for being stupid enough to do X/ not knowing how their computer works"; I find that a much more interesting question is "Why did the user believe their computer was safe in the first place ?"
- is versed in **feminism** 101 and adheres to it to a certain extent (see comment on *safe spaces* below)

The group is:

- **decentralised**: there is no one person responsible for organising meetups, anyone can offer a date and/or topic
- **private and familiar**: members know each other and most have met in person; by extension, they can feel more comfortable sharing (as opposed to mailing lists with hundreds of faceless members for example). The idea is not to be exclusionary, but to strike a balance between that and "click-attend-and-forget" behaviour; so tell your friends who are interested in infosec and would be a good fit!
- **independent** and sponsor-free: meetups are held in cafes and public areas
- about **education**: amongst ourselves, but also to others; see above about not blaming the user, but helping people be more comfortable with technology and understand technology better

Meetups are:

- **informal and low-pressure**: no specific topic has to be given; so no worries about preparing something. Also feel free to suggest a topic that you don't know anything about but want to learn more about
- **frequent**: this depends on people organising meetups. At least once a month
- **safe spaces** which we define as a space where we can be free for a few hours from the usual microaggressions (eg. "it's so easy to find a job as a woman in tech") that can be heard daily. This also goes for microaggressions against any minority groups. We also adhere to the [geek feminism Code of Conduct](https://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/)

On the long-term, we hope to work on bigger and more involved projects together that would have a positive impact on anything in the infosec world (for example, something like online harassment and privacy violations). We also aim to participate in [CTFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security) and go to conferences, such as the [CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) (every christmas in Hamburg, Germany).

Some resources to get started for meetup topics and activities (mainly pentesting listed here, but more to come):

Thanks to [Camilla](https://github.com/Winterflower) for coming up with a cool name for an infosec group ([honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)))
